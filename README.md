
## Summary

An Arduino-based Morse code practice keyer


## Description

This practice keyer software supports iambic (A/B) decoding only, it does not have a straight key decoding capability. The C code written for the Arduino IDE.

The hardware has an open-collector "key-down" output, so it could be used to add iambic keyer capability for older radios that do not natively support iambic keying.
